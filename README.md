# The FAAST System: Makers Academy Week 1 Challenge

Using Ruby and rspec to implement TDD, we are meant to design a tube system.
The FAAST system will include stations that hold a number of trains, trains with
a number of carriages, and carriages that hold up to 40 passengers.

## Languages and Tools
This system is written in Ruby, using the Rspec testing suite. TDD was done in a combination of Chicago and London styles, with heavy use of [Rspec mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks).

### To Open
In your terminal:
```shell
	git clone git@github.com:barr-code/FAAST.git
```	

### To Run Tests
```
	rspec
```
